# archdots

These are my dotfiles for an arch-based Linux build! I had a lot of fun doing this, but I probably will never do something
like this again. Not for Arch itself, it's just too time consuming and I only got 3/4 of the way to where I could actually use this
for more than a glorified terminal emulator...
